# Classification-of-chest-x-ray-images-using-deep-learning-and-transfer-learning

To utilize deep learning and transfer learning in classifying
a given greyscale Chest X-Ray image as pneumonia infected or not in medical
application to significantly reduce the time required to diagnose a person with
pneumonia. The training of the model is to classify the Chest X-Ray images has
a huge data set which requires a lot of processing power and time, to reduce
the time required to train the model we used Distributed Deep Learning with
multiple nodes.
